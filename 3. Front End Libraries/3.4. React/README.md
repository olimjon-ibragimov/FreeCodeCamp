# React: Notes

* **JSX** - a syntax extension of JavaScript, that allows you to write (render) HTML directly within JavaScript.

* JavaScript can be written within JSX if used between curly braces { }.

* JSX is not valid JavaScript, so it has to be compiled into JavaScript. Transpiler **Babel** is one of the tools for such a process.

* With React, we can render JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM. To render any React element to the DOM, use `ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`
  * This function call places your JSX into Reactâ€™s own lightweight representation of DOM. React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating only specific parts of the actual DOM.
  * It should be called after JSX element declarations.
  * Node can be selected using `document.getElementById('node-id')`

* Differences between JSX and HTML
  * `className` vs. `class`
    * in JSX, you can no longer use the word `class` to define HTML classes. This is because `class` is a reserved word in JavaScript. JSX uses `className`.
    * All HTML attributes and event references in JSX must be named with camelCase convention. 
  * Self-closing tags
    * In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag.
    * In JSX, any element can be written with a self-closing tag unless there is a child element inside of it.
        * `<div></div>` can be written as `<div />`.
        * Line-break tag: `<br />`

* Components are the core of React. Everything is a component.
  * 2 ways to create a component:
    * 1st way - use a JavaScript function - **STATELESS FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT**
        * **Stateless functional component** can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data.
        * To create a component with a function, write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or `null`.
        * Example: 
            ```
            // After being transpiled, the <div> will have a CSS class of 'customClass'
            const DemoComponent = function() {
                return (
                    <div className='customClass' />
                );
            };
            ```
        * Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.
    * 2nd way - ES6 `class` syntax - created class extends `React.Component` class
        * This class then has many useful React features, such as:
            * Local state
            * Lifecycle hooks
        * Example:
            ```
            class Kitten extends React.Component {
                constructor(props) {
                    super(props);
                }

                render() {
                    return (
                    <h1>Hi</h1>
                    );
                }
            }
            ```
        * `Kitten`'s constructor uses `super()` which calls the constructor of the parent class, in this case `React.Component`. 
        * The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the `class` keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with `super`, and pass `props` to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly. 

  * Overview:
    * A **stateless functional component** is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. 
    * A **stateless component**, on the other hand, is a class that extends `React.Component`, but does not use internal state.
    * A **stateful component** is a class component that does maintain its own internal state. You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.

  * Common pattern:
    * Try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application. In turn, this improves development and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.


* Component Composition
  * Component composition is one of React's powerful features. When you work with React, it is important to start thinking about your user interface in terms of components like the App example in the last challenge. You break down your UI into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components. This helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling your application logic. It can greatly simplify the development and maintenance of complex projects.

  * Imagine you are building an App and have created three components, a `Navbar`, `Dashboard`, and `Footer`. To compose these components together, you could create an `App` parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the `render` method you could write:
      ```
      return (
          <App>
          <Navbar />
          <Dashboard />
          <Footer />
          </App>
      )
      ```
      * When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in `< />` like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag.
  
  * You can render JSX elements, stateless functional components, and ES6 class components within other components.

* Rendering React components
  * None of the React code you write will render to the DOM without making a call to the ReactDOM API.
  * React components are passed to the API a little differently than JSX elements. You need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component:
    ```
    ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender / >, targetNode)
    ```
    * This syntax is used for both ES6 class components and functional components.
    
* **Props** (a.k.a properties)
  * In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an `App` component which renders a child component called `Welcome` which is a stateless functional component. You can pass `Welcome` a `user` property by writing:
    ```
    <App>
      <Welcome user='Mark' />
    </App>
    ```
  * You use custom HTML attributes created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property `user` is passed to the component `Welcome`. **Note that for prop values to be evaluated as JavaScript, they must be enclosed in curly brackets**: 
    ```
    const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>
    ```
  * When rendering an array in the child component, `join(", ")` method can be used to create a string out of elements of the array: 
    ```
    const ChildComponent = (props) => <p>{props.colors.join(', ')}</p>

    <ParentComponent>
      <ChildComponent colors={["green", "blue", "red"]} />
    </ParentComponent>
    ```
  * Default props
    *  You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary. This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided.
      ```
      MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' }
      ```
    * React assigns default props if props are undefined, but if you pass `null` as the value for a prop, it will remain `null`.
  
  * PropTypes
    * You can set propTypes on your component to require the data to be of type array. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.
    * It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps.
    * Example: 
      ```
      MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }
      ```
    * The `PropTypes.func` part checks that `handleClick` is a function. Adding `isRequired` tells React that `handleClick` is a required property for that component. You will see a warning if that prop isn't provided. Also notice that `func` represents `function`. **Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, function and `boolean` (written as `bool`) are the only two that use unusual spelling.** In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. For example, you can check that a prop is a React element. Please refer to the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#specifying-the-react-element-type) for all of the options.
    * `PropTypes` is imported independently from React (as of v15.5.0):
      ```
      import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
      ```

  * Accessing props in ES6 class components
    * Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the `this` keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with `this`. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called `data`, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.

* **State**
  * One of the most important topics in React
  * State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time. Your appls should be able to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.
  * You create state in a React component by declaring a `state` property on the component class in its `constructor`. This initializes the component with `state` when it is created.
  * The component must be created by extending `React.Component` in order for state to work
  * The `state` property must be set to a JavaScript object:
    ```
    this.state = {
      // describe your state here
    }
    ```
  * You can:
    * update it
    * render it in UI
    * pass as props to child components
  * Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in `state` in its `render()` method. You can access the data with `this.state`.
  * Note that if you make a component stateful, **no other components are aware of its state**. Its state is completely **encapsulated**, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props. This notion of encapsulated state is very important because it allows you to write certain logic, then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.
  * There is another way to access state in a component:
    * In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. You could:
      * declare functions
      * access data from state or props
      * perform computations on this data, and so on. 
    * Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.
  * `this.setState` 
    * The previous challenges covered component state and how to initialize state in the constructor. There is also a way to change the component's state. React provides a method for updating component state called setState. You call the setState method within your component class like so: this.setState(), passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a username in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:

      ```
      this.setState({
        username: 'Lewis'
      });
      ```
    * React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the setState method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the setState method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind! Please consult the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) for further details.

  * **Bind 'this' to a Class Method**
    * In addition to setting and updating `state`, you can also define methods for your component class. A class method typically needs to use the `this` keyword so it can access properties on the class (such as state and props) inside the scope of the method. There are a few ways to allow your class methods to access this.
    * One common way is to explicitly bind this in the constructor so this becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. You may have noticed the last challenge used `this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)` for its handleClick method in the constructor. Then, when you call a function like this.setState() within your class method, this refers to the class and will not be undefined.
    * Note: The this keyword is one of the most confusing aspects of JavaScript but it plays an important role in React. Although its behavior here is totally normal, these lessons aren't the place for an in-depth review of this so please refer to other lessons if the above is confusing!

  * Use state to toggle an element
    * Sometimes you might need to know the previous state when updating the state. However, state updates may be asynchronous - this means React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update. This means you can't rely on the previous value of this.state or this.props when calculating the next value. So, you should not use code like this:
  
      ```
      this.setState({
        counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment
      });
      ```
    * Instead, you should pass setState a function that allows you to access state and props. Using a function with setState guarantees you are working with the most current values of state and props. This means that the above should be rewritten as:

      ```
      this.setState((state, props) => ({
        counter: state.counter + props.increment
      }));
      ```
    * You can also use a form without props if you need only the state:
      
      ```
      this.setState(state => ({
        counter: state.counter + 1
      }));
      ```

    * Note that you have to wrap the object literal in parentheses, otherwise JavaScript thinks it's a block of code.

  * Controlled Input
    * Your application may have more complex interactions between `state` and the rendered UI. For example, form control elements for text input, such as `input` and `textarea`, maintain their own state in the DOM as the user types. With React, you can move this mutable state into a React component's `state`. The user's input becomes part of the application `state`, so React controls the value of that input field. Typically, if you have React components with input fields the user can type into, it will be a controlled input form.

  * Pass state as props to child components
    * You saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.
    * For example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.
    * This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is unidirectional data flow. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. **It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.**
  
  * Pass a Callback as Props
    * You can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under `this.props` in the child component.

* **Lifecycle methods**
  * React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called **lifecycle methods**, or **lifecycle hooks**, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:
    * `componentWillMount()` 
      * The `componentWillMount()` method is called before the `render()` method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. 
    * `componentDidMount()`
      * Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.
      * The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method `componentDidMount()`. This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to `setState()` here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.
      * This method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.
        * You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.
    * `shouldComponentUpdate()`
      * So far, if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.
      * This method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new props, even if the props haven't changed. You can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (this.props) to the next props (nextProps) to determine if you need to update or not, and return true or false accordingly.
    * `componentDidUpdate()` 
    * `componentWillUnmount()`

* **Inline Styles**
  * You apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:
    ```
    <div style="color: yellow; font-size: 16px">Mellow Yellow</div>
    ```
  * JSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a string. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:
    ```
    <div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>
    ```
  * Notice how we camelCase the "fontSize" property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object. React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.
  * All property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. If you want to use em, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like `{fontSize: "4em"}`. Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.
  * If you have a large set of styles, you can assign a style object to a constant to keep your code organized. 
  * **Changing inline CSS conditionally based on component state**
    * At this point, you've seen several applications of conditional rendering and the use of inline styles. Here's one more example that combines both of these topics. You can also render CSS conditionally based on the state of a React component. To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.
    * This paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly. It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition, you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. This is the preferred method when writing applications with React.

* **Render Method**
  * JavaScript
    * You can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.
  * If-Else condition
    * Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. When the condition is true, one view renders. When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard if/else statement in the render() method of a React component.
  * && Conditional
    * The if/else statements worked in the last challenge, but there's a more concise way to achieve the same result. Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is true, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:

      ```
      {condition && <p>markup</p>}
      ```
    * If the condition is true, the markup will be returned. If the condition is false, the operation will immediately return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your render() method without repeating a lot of code.
  * Ternary Expression (?)
    * Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/else statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional if/else statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, if/else statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago â€” when an if/else statement was required, it was always outside the return statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:
      ```
      condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
      ```
  * Rendering conditionally from props
    * Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers â€” that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render:
      ```
      class Results extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
        }
        render() {
          {/* Change code below this line */}
          return <h1>{this.props.fiftyFifty ? "You Win!" : "You Lose!"}</h1>;
          {/* Change code above this line */}
        }
      }
      ```
  * Rendering dynamically
    * **Array.map()**
      * Conditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements. Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using Array.map() in React illustrates this concept.
      * For example, you create a simple "To Do List" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many items a user might have on their list. You need to set up your component to dynamically render the correct number of list elements long before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day.
      * When you create an array of elements, each one needs a key attribute set to a unique value. React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way.
        * Note: Keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.
    * **Array.filter()**
      * The map array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React. Another method related to map is filter, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array. For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property online which can be set to true or false, you can filter only those users that are online by writing:
        ```
        let onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.online);
        ```
* **Rendering on the server with `renderToString`**
  * So far, you have been rendering React components on the client. Normally, this is what you will always do. However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a renderToString() method you can use for this purpose.
  * There are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.



# React: Tasks

## 1. Create a simple JSX element

```
const JSX = <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>
```

## 2. Create a complex JSX element

You can also put the complex element inside parentheses `( )`.

```
const JSX = <div>
                <h1>Header Text</h1>
                <p>Paragraph</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unordered list element 1</li>
                    <li>Unordered list element 2</li>
                    <li>Unordered list element 3</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
```

## 3. Add coments in JSX

To put comments inside JSX, use the syntax `{/* */}` to wrap around the comment text.

```
const JSX = (
  <div>
    {/*THIS IS A SIMPLE COMMENT*/}
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
  </div>
);
```

## 4. Render HTML elements to the DOM

```
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
  </div>
);
ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('challenge-node'))
```

## 5. Define an HTML class in JSX

```
const JSX = (
  <div className="myDiv">
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);
```

## 6. Learn about self-closing JSX tags

```
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br />
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr />
  </div>
);
```

## 7. Create a stateless functional component

```
const MyComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div>Example text</div>
  )
}
```

## 8. Create a React component

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello React!</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
};
```

## 9. Create a component with composition

```
const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        <ChildComponent />
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 10. Use React to render nested components

```
const TypesOfFruit = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Fruits:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Blueberries</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

const Fruits = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <TypesOfFruit />
    </div>
  );
};

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        <Fruits />
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 11. Compose React components
```
class Fruits extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Fruits:</h2>
        <NonCitrus />
        <Citrus />
      </div>
    );
  }
};

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
     super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        <Fruits />
        <Vegetables />
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 12. Render a class component to the DOM
```
class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        <Fruits />
        <Vegetables />
      </div>
    );
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(<TypesOfFood />, document.getElementById("challenge-node"))
```

## 13. Write a react component from scratch
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>My First React Component!</h1>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById("challenge-node"));
```

## 14. Pass props to a stateless functional component
```
const CurrentDate = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>The current date is: {props.date} </p>
    </div>
  );
};

class Calendar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>What date is it?</h3>
        <CurrentDate date={Date()} />
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 15. Pass an array as props
```
const List = (props) => {
  return <p>{props.tasks.join(", ")}</p>
};

class ToDo extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>To Do Lists</h1>
        <h2>Today</h2>
        <List tasks={["walk dog", "workout"]} />
        <h2>Tomorrow</h2>
        <List tasks={["walk dog", "workout"]} />
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 16. Use default props
```
const ShoppingCart = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shopping Cart Component</h1>
    </div>
  )
};

ShoppingCart.defaultProps = {
  items: 0
}
```

## 17. Override default props
```
const Items = (props) => {
  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
}

Items.defaultProps = {
  quantity: 0
}

class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <Items quantity={10} />
  }
};
```

## 18. Use PropTypes to define the props you expect
```
const Items = (props) => {
  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
};

Items.propTypes = {
  quantity: PropTypes.number.isRequired
}

Items.defaultProps = {
  quantity: 0
};

class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <Items />
  }
};
```

## 19. Access props using this.props
```
class ReturnTempPassword extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Your temporary password is: <strong>{this.props.tempPassword}</strong></p>
        </div>
    );
  }
};

class ResetPassword extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
          <h2>Reset Password</h2>
          <h3>We've generated a new temporary password for you.</h3>
          <h3>Please reset this password from your account settings ASAP.</h3>
          <ReturnTempPassword tempPassword='abcdefgh' />
        </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 20. Review using props with stateless functional components
```
class CampSite extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Camper/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

const Camper = props => {
  return <p>{props.name}</p>
};

// const Camper = props => <p>{props.name}</p>;

Camper.defaultProps = {
  name: 'CamperBot'
};

Camper.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};
```

## 21. Create a stateful component
```
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Only change code below this line
      this.state = {
        name: "John"
      }
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 22. Render state in the user interface
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 23. Render state in the user interface another way
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    const name = this.state.name
    // Change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <h1>{name}</h1>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 24. Set state with this.setState
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'Initial State'
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    // Change code below this line
    this.setState({
      name: 'React Rocks!'
    });
    // Change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 25. Bind `this` to a class method
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      text: "Hello"
    };
    // Change code below this line
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
    // Change code above this line
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      text: "You clicked!"
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
        <h1>{this.state.text}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 26. Use state to toggle an element
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visibility: false
    };
    // Change code below this line
    this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this);
    // Change code above this line
  }
  // Change code below this line
  toggleVisibility() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      this.setState(state => ({
        visibility: false
      }))
    }
    else {
      this.setState(state => ({
        visibility: true
      }))
    }
      
  };
  // Change code above this line
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
}
```

## 27. Write a simple counter
```
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
    // Change code below this line
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this);
    this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this);
    this.reset = this.reset.bind(this);
    // Change code above this line
  }
  // Change code below this line
  increment() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      count: state.count + 1
    }))
  }

  decrement() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      count: state.count - 1
    }))
  }

  reset() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      count: 0
    }))
  }
  // Change code above this line
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button className='inc' onClick={this.increment}>Increment!</button>
        <button className='dec' onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement!</button>
        <button className='reset' onClick={this.reset}>Reset</button>
        <h1>Current Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 28. Create a controlled input
```
class ControlledInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: ''
    };
    // Change code below this line
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    // Change code above this line
  }
  // Change code below this line
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState(state => ({
      input: event.target.value
    }))
  }
  // Change code above this line
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */}
        <input value={this.state.input} onChange={this.handleChange}></input>
        { /* Change code above this line */}
        <h4>Controlled Input:</h4>
        <p>{this.state.input}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 29. Create a controlled form
```
class MyForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      submit: ''
    };
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    // Change code below this line
    event.preventDefault()
    this.setState({
      submit: this.state.input
    });
    // Change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          {/* Change code below this line */}
          <input value={this.state.input} onChange={this.handleChange}></input>
          {/* Change code above this line */}
          <button type='submit'>Submit!</button>
        </form>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        <h1>{this.state.submit}</h1>
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 30. Pass state as props to child components
```
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'CamperBot'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
       <div>
         {/* Change code below this line */}
         <Navbar name={this.state.name}/>
         {/* Change code above this line */}
       </div>
    );
  }
};

class Navbar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
    <div>
      {/* Change code below this line */}
      <h1>Hello, my name is: {this.props.name}</h1>
      {/* Change code above this line */}
    </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 31. Pass a callback as props
```
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      inputValue: ''
    } 
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      inputValue: event.target.value
    });
    console.log(this.state.inputValue)
  }
  render() {
    return (
       <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <GetInput input={this.state.inputValue} handleChange={this.handleChange} />
        <RenderInput input={this.state.inputValue} />
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
       </div>
    );
  }
};

class GetInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Get Input:</h3>
        <input
          value={this.props.input}
          onChange={this.props.handleChange}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

class RenderInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Input Render:</h3>
        <p>{this.props.input}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 32. Use the lifecycle method `componentWillMount` 
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  componentWillMount() {
    // Change code below this line
    console.log("Test")
    // Change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return <div />
  }
};
```

## 33. Use the lifecycle method `componentDidMount`
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      activeUsers: null
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({
        activeUsers: 1273
      });
    }, 2500);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        <h1>Active Users: {this.state.activeUsers}</h1>
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 34. Add event listener
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: ''
    };
    this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);
    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);
  }
  // Change code below this line
  componentDidMount() {
    document.addEventListener("keydown", this.handleKeyPress);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    document.removeEventListener("keydown", this.handleKeyPress);
  }
  // Change code above this line
  handleEnter() {
    this.setState((state) => ({
      message: state.message + 'You pressed the enter key! '
    }));
  }
  handleKeyPress(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 13) {
      this.handleEnter();
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 35. Optimize re-renders with `shouldComponentUpdate` 
```
class OnlyEvens extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log('Should I update?');
    // Change code below this line
    if (nextProps.value % 2 == 0){
      return true;
    }
    // Change code above this line
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('Component re-rendered.');
  }
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.value}</h1>;
  }
}

class Controller extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 0
    };
    this.addValue = this.addValue.bind(this);
  }
  addValue() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      value: state.value + 1
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.addValue}>Add</button>
        <OnlyEvens value={this.state.value} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 36. Introducing inline styles
```
class Colorful extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{color: "red", fontSize: 72}}>Big Red</div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 37. Add inline style in React
```
const styles = {color: "purple", fontSize: 40, border: "2px solid purple"}
// Change code above this line
class Colorful extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    return (
      <div style={styles}>Style Me!</div>
    );
    // Change code above this line
  }
};
```

## 38. Use advanced JavaScript in React render method
```
const inputStyle = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5
};

class MagicEightBall extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      userInput: '',
      randomIndex: ''
    };
    this.ask = this.ask.bind(this);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  ask() {
    if (this.state.userInput) {
      this.setState({
        randomIndex: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
        userInput: ''
      });
    }
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      userInput: event.target.value
    });
  }
  render() {
    const possibleAnswers = [
      'It is certain',
      'It is decidedly so',
      'Without a doubt',
      'Yes, definitely',
      'You may rely on it',
      'As I see it, yes',
      'Outlook good',
      'Yes',
      'Signs point to yes',
      'Reply hazy try again',
      'Ask again later',
      'Better not tell you now',
      'Cannot predict now',
      'Concentrate and ask again',
      "Don't count on it",
      'My reply is no',
      'My sources say no',
      'Most likely',
      'Outlook not so good',
      'Very doubtful'
    ];
    const answer = possibleAnswers[this.state.randomIndex]; // Change this line
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type='text'
          value={this.state.userInput}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          style={inputStyle}
        />
        <br />
        <button onClick={this.ask}>Ask the Magic Eight Ball!</button>
        <br />
        <h3>Answer:</h3>
        <p>
          {/* Change code below this line */}
          {answer}
          {/* Change code above this line */}
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 39. Render with an if-else condition
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      display: true
    }
    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.setState((state) => ({
      display: !state.display
    }));
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    if (this.state.display) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
          <h1>Displayed!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }
    else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
};
```

## 40. Use && for a more concise conditional
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      display: true
    }
    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      display: !state.display
    }));
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
         {this.state.display && <h1>Displayed!</h1>}
       </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 41. Use a ternary expression for conditional rendering
```
const inputStyle = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5
};

class CheckUserAge extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Change code below this line
    this.state = {
      userAge: '',
      input: ''
    };
    // Change code above this line
    this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({
      input: e.target.value,
      userAge: ''
    });
  }
  submit() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      userAge: state.input
    }));
  }
  render() {
    const buttonOne = <button onClick={this.submit}>Submit</button>;
    const buttonTwo = <button>You May Enter</button>;
    const buttonThree = <button>You Shall Not Pass</button>;
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Enter Your Age to Continue</h3>
        <input
          style={inputStyle}
          type='number'
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
        />
        <br />
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        {
          this.state.userAge === ''
            ? buttonOne
            : this.state.userAge >= 18
              ? buttonTwo
              : buttonThree
        }
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 42. Render conditionally from props
```
class Results extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    {/* Change code below this line */}
    return <h1>{this.props.fiftyFifty ? "You Win!" : "You Lose!"}</h1>;
    {/* Change code above this line */}
  }
}
 
class GameOfChance extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 1
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      counter: this.state.counter + 1// Change this line
    });
  }
  render() {
    const expression = Math.random() >= .5; // Change this line
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Play Again</button>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        <Results fiftyFifty={expression} />
        {/* Change code above this line */}
        <p>{'Turn: ' + this.state.counter}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 43. Change inline CSS conditionally based on component state
```
class GateKeeper extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: ''
    };
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({ input: event.target.value })
  }
  render() {
    let inputStyle = {
      border: '1px solid black'
    };
    // Change code below this line
    if (this.state.input.length > 15) {
      inputStyle.border = '3px solid red';
    };
    // Change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Don't Type Too Much:</h3>
        <input
          type="text"
          style={inputStyle}
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange} />
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## 44. User `array.map()` to dynamically render elements
```
const textAreaStyles = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5
};

class MyToDoList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Change code below this line
    this.state = {
      userInput: '',
      toDoList: []
    }
    // Change code above this line
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleSubmit() {
    const itemsArray = this.state.userInput.split(',');
    this.setState({
      toDoList: itemsArray
    });
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    console.log(e.target.value)
    this.setState({
      userInput: e.target.value
    });
  }
  render() {
    const items = this.state.toDoList.map(i => <li>{i}</li>)
    return (
      <div>
        <textarea
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          value={this.state.userInput}
          style={textAreaStyles}
          placeholder='Separate Items With Commas'
        />
        <br />
        <button onClick={this.handleSubmit}>Create List</button>
        <h1>My "To Do" List:</h1>
        <ul>{items}</ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 45. Give sibling elements a unique key attribute
```
const frontEndFrameworks = [
  'React',
  'Angular',
  'Ember',
  'Knockout',
  'Backbone',
  'Vue'
];

function Frameworks() {
  const renderFrameworks = frontEndFrameworks.map(
    (item) => <li key={item}>{item}</li>
  ); // Change this line
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Popular Front End JavaScript Frameworks</h1>
      <ul>
        {renderFrameworks}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 46. User `Array.filter()` to dynamically filter an array
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      users: [
        {
          username: 'Jeff',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Alan',
          online: false
        },
        {
          username: 'Mary',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Jim',
          online: false
        },
        {
          username: 'Sara',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Laura',
          online: true
        }
      ]
    };
  }
  render() {
    const usersOnline = this.state.users.filter(user => user.online); // Change this line
    const renderOnline = usersOnline.map(
      (user) => <li key={user.username}>{user.username}</li>
    ); // Change this line
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Current Online Users:</h1>
        <ul>{renderOnline}</ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 47. Render React on the server with renderToString
```
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <div/>
  }
};

// Change code below this line
ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />)
```
